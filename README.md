#Botnet detection
Intrusion detection on device network 

Botnet network is a sophisticated network of bots used
by cyber criminals to launch malicious activities over the
internet. Botnet based attack is one of the major challenges
on network devices. Detection of attack in network device is notably distinct
since it requires specific requirements for instance low
latency, mobility, and distributed nature. Botnet size varies
from small botnet consists of few hundred bots to the large
botnets with 50,000 hosts. Hackers spread botnet malware
and operate secretly without any noticeable indication of their
presence and can remain effective and functioning for years
Current security systems greatly depend on mathematical
models which often do not signify the systems accuracy and
appropriate security in wireless environment requires hefty
mathematical solutions which causes long computational time
and create complexity . Machine learning algorithms will
therefore undertake a crucial part in IoT security system, since
it is effective in modelling systems that cannot be introduced
by a mathematical equations.

#A. Data preprocessing
Data preprocessing is the first and one of the most important
stages in building machine learning model. Bad data can
produce inaccurate result. To get correct output at very first
stage, dataset is analyzed, and formatting is done. 

#B. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering technique is applied as a part of
machine learning approach which helped in dimensionality
reduction which thereby minimized the problem of over-fitting.
This improved accuracy, and significantly reduced processing
time. Also, it was beneficial in selecting appropriate features
that contain most important information about target variable
and helped to improve the performance of model.

#C. Synthetic Minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE)
SMOTE is one of the effective techniques to make class
balance dataset. Imbalanced dataset may cause misclassifying
problems which effect on the performance of machine learning
algorithms. Thereforem teh dataset which was initailly imbalanced was balanced with this technique


#D Comparison of performance of Machine learning algorithms
In this Botnet detection model, we combined feature engineeri
